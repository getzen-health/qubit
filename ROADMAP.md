# GetZen — Roadmap to Launch

## What GetZen Is
A health tracking app combining **Bevel-style** dashboards with **Yuka-style** food scanning.
- iOS (Swift/SwiftUI) reads Apple Health → syncs to cloud
- Web dashboard (Next.js 14) visualises all metrics + AI insights
- ZenScore™ food health scoring (like Yuka, built from scratch)

## Quality Gates (enforced before every PR)
```
✅ npx tsc --noEmit          → 0 errors
✅ xcodebuild (Catalyst)     → BUILD SUCCEEDED
✅ All new API routes        → createSecureApiHandler + Zod + rateLimit
✅ All new DB tables         → RLS + user_id filter on every query
✅ No Co-authored-by         → commits by Rajashekarredde only
✅ Branch protection         → feature branch → PR → merge (no direct push to main)
```

---

## Architecture
```
/ios        Swift/SwiftUI — HealthKit → Supabase sync
/web        Next.js 14 App Router — dashboard, food scanner, AI insights
/supabase   Postgres migrations, RLS, Edge Functions
/docs       App Store assets, API reference, architecture
```
